# First Student Real Time Web App - Bus Locator & Route Replay

## Project Overview

First Student is the largest provider of school bus services in North America. This project will provide two real-time features as part of their bigger FOCUS 2.0 initiative. These two real-time features include Bus Locator & Route Replay. These features will be used by dispatchers who are located in a bus depot (hub, lob) to coordinate and manage the various details that go into effectively and essentially getting kids to and from school. There are several pieces involved: drivers, buses, routes, locations, schools, districts, and students.

Bus Locator is seeing the real time locations of multiple busses. This uses real-time GPS data.
Route Replay is seeing the planned and actual routes defined for buses. This uses planned routed and real-time GPS data for the actual route a bus takes.

        - Windows: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-ssh-windows.html
3. Clone repo 
    - Repo: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/repositories/FG-A-FS-RealTimeUIApps/setup?region=us-east-1
    - Clone URL: ssh://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/FG-A-FS-RealTimeUIApps
4. Configure AWS (Take default for everything unless defined)
    - `amplify configure`
        - `us-east-1`
    - `amplify pull`
        - Use profile created from the configure step
5. Start Development!
    - `yarn install`

## Branch, Commit, Pull Request, Build, and Deployment

### Branching
- All Development should work against the `dev` branch
- Branch names should be based off the template: `<change-type>/<dev-name>/<ticket-number>-<description>`
  - `change-type` is either `bug`, `feature`, or `chore`
  - `dev-name` is your first name or nickname in all lower case letters
  - `ticket-numer` is the JIRA ticket, capitalized and with dashes removed. For example, `RTBLRR75`
  - `description` is a short, all lowercase, dash separated description. For example, `my-update`
  - Example branch name: `feature/shah/RTBLRR75-setup-sidebar`
